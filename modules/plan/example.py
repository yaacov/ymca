    Task: "Tell me about kubectl-mtv migration tool"

    ITERATION 1:

    ITERATION 2:
    - Action: smart_web_search("kubectl-mtv features capabilities")
    - New info: "It supports migrating VMs from VMware vSphere, RHV, OpenStack to OpenShift virtualization"
    - evolving_answer: "Based on the research for 'Tell me about kubectl-mtv migration tool':

    ITERATION 3:

                       Key Features:
                       - Supports migrating VMs from VMware vSphere, RHV, OpenStack to OpenShift virtualization
                       - Provides commands for managing migration lifecycle

                       Common Usage:
                       - kubectl mtv create plan - Create migration plans
                       - kubectl mtv start migration - Start VM migrations
                       - kubectl mtv get status - Check migration status"

    The evolving_answer gets progressively more comprehensive and well-structured as we gather more information.

    1. plan.evolving_answer (str)
       - The main cumulative answer that gets updated with each new piece of information

       - Gets refined and restructured by LLM as new info is integrated

    2. plan.knowledge_pieces (List[str])
       - Raw pieces of information collected from each successful tool call
       - Used for tracking what information was gathered
       - Can be useful for debugging or alternative synthesis approaches

    3. plan.result (str)
       - Final answer returned to user

    Update Process:
    1. Tool executes successfully â†’ get result
    2. Call _update_evolving_answer(plan, result)
    3. Add result to plan.knowledge_pieces
    4. If first info: create initial structure

    2. SUBSEQUENT PIECES:

         * Current answer
         * New information
         * Instructions to integrate without redundancy
       - LLM restructures and combines information intelligently

    3. FINAL ANSWER:
       - When reasoning determines task is complete
       - Final answer can override evolving_answer if needed
       - Otherwise uses current evolving_answer as result

    4. FALLBACK:
